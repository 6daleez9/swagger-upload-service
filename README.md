Overview
--------
Swagger Upload Service is a compact Node.js microservice designed to handle Swagger files securely. It provides a clean API for uploading Swagger specifications (YAML or JSON), validating them against a set of rules, and storing them for later use by downstream services. Access is protected with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring that only administrators can upload new Swagger documents. The service is designed to run in modern cloud environments, is Dockerized, and wired into a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automatic builds, Docker Hub publications, and EC2 deployments.

Why this project matters
-------------------------
- Centralizes Swagger management: Keep all your Swagger specs in one place with consistent validation rules.
- Tight security: Roles and tokens guard critical upload operations.
- Easy deployment: Dockerized builds and CI/CD enable seamless deployment to AWS EC2 or similar environments.
- Lightweight and fast: A focused service that complements a broader API gateway or microservices architecture.

Key capabilities
---------------
- Admin-only upload: Upload Swagger specs via file or text input, with immediate validation.
- Swagger YAML/JSON validation: Validate syntax and structure, with clear error messages.
- RBAC with JWT: Enforce admin-only write access while allowing read or validation endpoints to be used by authenticated users.
- Dockerized delivery: Build, test, image creation, and deployment scripts integrate with GitLab CI/CD.
- Deployment-ready: Ready-to-run instructions for EC2, with optional Docker Hub deployment.
- MongoDB persistence: Store metadata and references to Swagger documents for fast retrieval and auditing.

Architecture and design
-----------------------
Swagger Upload Service is a modular Node.js application built with a clean separation of concerns. The authentication layer uses JWTs to verify users and their roles. A dedicated authorization middleware ensures only admin users can perform upload actions, while validation endpoints remain accessible according to policy. The Swagger parsing and validation logic is isolated in its own service layer to keep concerns small and testable.

Security model
--------------
- JWT-based authentication: Each request must present a valid token issued by your identity provider.
- RBAC: The system enforces an admin role for write operations. Read and validate operations can be scoped to authenticated users where appropriate.
- Input validation: Swagger input is sanitized and parsed with strict schema validation to prevent injection or malformed specs from causing harm.
- Secrets management: Sensitive data (JWT keys, DB credentials) is stored in environment variables or secret managers in your production environment.

Tech stack
----------
- Node.js: Lightweight server for API endpoints
- Express (or alternative) middleware: Routing, error handling, and request processing
- JWT (jsonwebtoken): Token generation and verification
- MongoDB + Mongoose: Metadata persistence
- Swagger validation: YAML/JSON parsing and spec validation
- Docker: Containerization for consistency across environments
- GitLab CI/CD: Automated builds, tests, image publishing, and deployment workflows

How it works
------------
1) Client authenticates and obtains a JWT with a role that includes admin privileges.
2) Admin user uploads a Swagger file (YAML or JSON) via the admin endpoint, or sends Swagger text directly.
3) The service validates the Swagger spec for syntax correctness and conformance to internal rules.
4) If valid, the spec is stored in the database and the metadata is exposed via read endpoints.
5) CI/CD builds the Docker image, pushes to Docker Hub, and can deploy to EC2 or any compatible host.

Usage scenarios
-------------
- Centralized swagger management for a microservices ecosystem
- Admin-controlled swagger publication to downstream services
- Validation of external swagger specs before use in environments like API gateways
- Auditable record of swagger changes with history tracking

Getting the code running locally
--------------------------------
Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/6daleez9/swagger-upload-service.git
- cd swagger-upload-service

Install dependencies:
- npm install

Create a local environment file:
- Copy config/env.example.json to config/.env.json (or use your preferred env strategy)
- Edit values for:
  - JWT_SECRET: the secret used to sign tokens
  - MONGO_URI: your local MongoDB connection string
  - API_PORT: port for the service
  - DOCKER_REGISTRY or DOCKER_HUB credentials (for CI/CD)

Run with Docker
---------------
If you want to run the service in Docker, you can build and start the container:

- docker build -t swagger-upload-service:latest .
- docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your_secret \
  -e MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/swagger \
  -e API_PORT=3000 \
  swagger-upload-service:latest

During local testing, you may also use Docker Compose to spin up MongoDB and the service together:
- docker-compose up -d

APIs and endpoints
------------------
Note: The endpoints described below reflect typical patterns for a secure swagger-upload service. The actual implementation may differ in your codebase, but the semantic remains the same.

  - Response: { "id": "<document-id>", "status": "uploaded", "validated": true/false, "errors": [...] }

Swagger validation
- POST /swagger/validate
  - Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
  - Body: { "swagger": "<yaml or json string>" }
  - Response: { "valid": true, "errors": [] }

Swagger retrieval
- GET /swagger/:id
  - Authorization: Bearer <JWT> (if required by policy)
  - Response: { "id": "...", "swagger": "...", "metadata": {...} }

Admin management
- GET /admin/roles
  - List roles
- POST /admin/roles
  - Create role
- POST /admin/users
  - Create user and assign role
- POST /admin/assign-role
  - Assign role to user

Data model
----------
- User: username, password hash, roles, createdAt, updatedAt
- Role: name (admin, user, viewer), permissions
- SwaggerDocument: id, authorId, version, createdAt, updatedAt, status, validationErrors, rawContent

Validation rules
---------------
- YAML/JSON syntax must be parseable
- Swagger version compatible with OpenAPI 3.x
- Required fields like info.title, info.version, paths must be present
- Disallow unsupported fields or known security vulnerabilities
- Referential integrity across components
- Size limits on swagger documents to prevent abuse

CI/CD and deployment
--------------------
GitLab CI/CD pipelines are configured to:
- Lint and test the code
- Run unit and integration tests
- Build a Docker image
- Push the image to Docker Hub
- Deploy the service to EC2 via a deployment script or an orchestration tool

CI/CD pipeline details
- Stages: lint, test, build, push, deploy
- Runners: shared or self-hosted
- Triggers: on push to main or on release tags
- Environment: separate configs for development, staging, and production

Docker and registry
- The repository ships a Dockerfile that builds a minimal runtime image
- The image is designed to be portable across environments
- Docker Hub is the target for public image distribution
- The deployment script in the repo handles pulling the image and starting a container on EC2

AWS and deployment considerations
- EC2 is a common target for deployment
- You can use a managed database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) or a self-hosted MongoDB on AWS
- Security groups should allow inbound traffic on your API port
- Use an orchestration tool or a launcher script to keep the service running and to manage logs

Release management
------------------
Releases page on GitHub holds release assets, including binaries, scripts, and deployment manifests. You can browse the releases to grab a file suitable for your platform and run it as part of your deployment.

Security and access control details
-----------------------------------
JWT-based authentication
- The system issues tokens after a successful login
- Tokens include an origin, expiry, and roles claim
- Middlewares verify tokens and enforce proper permissions

Role-based access
- Admin role grants permission to upload and manage swagger documents
- Other roles may view or validate swagger content depending on policy
- Access controls are enforced on the server side, not just in the client

Input handling
- Swagger uploads can be accepted as a file or a raw string
- The files are parsed into a structured object for validation
- Validation errors are returned clearly with actionable messages

Operational stability
- Timeouts and retries are configured to handle network hiccups
- Logs capture who did what, when, and with which input
- Health checks are exposed for container orchestration

Performance considerations
- Validation is optimized to minimize CPU usage
- Large Swagger files are handled with streaming parsers where possible
- MongoDB indexes speed up lookups for swagger documents and metadata

Testing strategy
---------------
Unit tests
- Validate parsing logic, token handling, and role checks
- Mock external dependencies to ensure deterministic tests

Integration tests
- Test end-to-end flows: login, upload, validation, retrieval
- Verify RBAC under different token configurations

Test data and fixtures
- Use a dedicated test database
- Seed roles and an admin user for integration tests
- Include a few sample swagger specs to exercise validation rules

Code quality and standards

Appendix: sample Swagger upload workflow
----------------------------------------
Here is a representative workflow for an admin to upload and validate a Swagger spec:

1) Admin authenticates and obtains a JWT with admin privileges.
2) Admin sends a swagger YAML document to the upload endpoint.
3) The service parses the YAML, performs structural validation, checks for required fields, and ensures references are resolvable.
4) If all checks pass, the document is stored and a metadata entry is created, including the author, version, and timestamp.
5) Admin can then fetch the document or re-run validation to verify ongoing conformance.

Appendix: sample Swagger document (inline example)
-----------------------------------------------
An inline example swagger spec is provided to illustrate validation. This is a minimal example and should be replaced by real Swagger content in your environment.

{
  "openapi": "3.0.3",
  "info": {
    "title": "Sample API",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A minimal Swagger document used for validation testing."
  },
  "paths": {
    "/health": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Health check",
        "responses": {
